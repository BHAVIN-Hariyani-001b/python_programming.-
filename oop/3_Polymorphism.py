# Operator Overloading ***************************
# Operator Overloading means giving extended meaning beyond their predefined operational meaning. For example operator + is used to add two integers as well as join two strings and merge two lists. It is achievable because '+' operator is overloaded by int class and str class. You might have noticed that the same built-in operator or function shows different behavior for objects of different classes, this is called Operator Overloading. 

# Python program to show use of
# + operator for different purposes.

# print(1 + 2)

# # concatenate two strings
# print("Geeks"+"For") 

# # Product two numbers
# print(3 * 4)

# # Repeat the String
# print("Geeks"*4)
